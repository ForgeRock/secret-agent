The `secret-agent` is a Kubernetes operator that generates the secrets required by the ForgeRock® Identity Platform. The secrets are stored in-cluster as Kubernetes secrets and can also be stored in a cloud secret manager.

## Installation

To install the latest `secret-agent` release in a Kubernetes environment, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/ForgeRock/secret-agent/releases/latest/download/secret-agent.yaml
```

Specific versions of the operator can be installed by running:

```bash
SA_VERSION=v0.1.0 kubectl apply -f https://github.com/ForgeRock/secret-agent/releases/download/${SA_VERSION}/secret-agent.yaml
```

## Configuration

Once the operator is installed, new secrets can be generated by providing a secret agent configuration (SAC) object. The SAC is a custom kubernetes object monitored by the `secret-agent` operator. All the secrets’ specifications are defined through the SAC.

For more information on how to create a SAC, see the [Secret Agent Configuration Schema](#secret-agent-configuration-schema) and/or the [Examples](#examples) sections.

Once the SAC file has been created, it can be pushed to the cluster as with any other resource.

For example:

```bash
kubectl create -f config/samples/secret-agent_v1alpha1_secretagentconfiguration.yaml
```

It is important to note that the Kubernetes secrets produced by the `secret-agent` will be placed in the same namespace as the SAC. If similar secrets are desired in multiple namespaces, one SAC would be required per namespace.

## Usage

### Enabling Cloud Backup

The `secret-agent` can be configured to back up all the generated secrets in a cloud provider's secret manager solution. When this feature is enabled, secrets stored in the secret managers are considered the source of truth.

If a cloud provider has been configured, the operator will attempt to load the secret data from that cloud provider. If the secret is found in the cloud provider's secret manager, the operator will use the found data as the Kubernetes secret data. The operator will only generate new secrets if no secret data is found in the cloud provider.

The `secret-agent` supports the following cloud providers:

* Google Secret Manager
* AWS Secrets Manager
* ~~Azure Key Vault~~ (In progress: See #60)

It is possible to run the `secret-agent` without setting up a cloud provider. This is useful when debugging or testing applications. To disable cloud provider support, set `spec.appConfig.secretsManager` to “none”.

In order to fetch and store secrets in the AWS Secrets Manager, the user must provide credentials with the necessary permissions.

#### Set up Cloud Backup With AWS Secret Manager

The `secret-agent` expects credentials to be discoverable via standard [AWS mechanisms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials). These credentials can be provided in a number of ways, for example:

* Environment Variables: _AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_
* Shared Credentials file: _~/.aws/credentials_
* Shared Configuration file: _(~/.aws/config_
* EC2 Instance Metadata (preferred): _Obtains credentials from 169.254.169.254_

Refer to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_overview.html) for instructions on how to obtain credentials and grant necessary permissions to access the AWS Secrets Manager. The `secret-agent` needs to access read/write secrets. This can be achieved by allowing access to the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite` AWS managed policy.

Even though the recommended way to obtain credentials is to use the EC2 Instance Metadata service, it is possible to provide custom credentials via a Kubernetes secret. The secret reference is provided in the SAC in `spec.appConfig.credentialsSecretName`. The Kubernetes secret must be present in the same namespace as the operator.

Once these credentials are made available to the operator, the next step is to configure the AWS Secret Manager in the SecretAgentConfiguration.

For example, the following configuration targets AWS Secret Manager in `us-east-1`:

```yaml
apiVersion: secret-agent.secrets.forgerock.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretAgentConfiguration
metadata:
  name: standard-forgerock-example
spec:
  appConfig:
    createKubernetesObjects: true
    credentialsSecretName: cloud-credentials [** optional**]
    secretsManager: AWS
    awsRegion: us-east-1
```

**The maximum secret size supported by AWS is 65Kb** For more information, see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_limits.html).

#### Set up Cloud Backup With GCP Secret Manager

The `secret-agent` expects credentials to be discoverable via standard [GCP mechanisms](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication). These credentials can be provided in a number of ways, including user accounts and service accounts.

Please refer to the [GCP Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/libraries?hl=nl#cloud-console) for instructions on how to create a service account with the necessary permissions to access the GCP Secrets Manager. The `secret-agent` needs access to read/write secrets. This can be achieved by assigning the `Secret Manager Admin` role to the service account provided.

Once these credentials are made available to the operator using `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, the next step is to configure the GCP Secret Manager in the `SecretAgentConfiguration`.

For example, the following configuration targets GCP Secret Manager for the `example-project-id` project:

```yaml
apiVersion: secret-agent.secrets.forgerock.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretAgentConfiguration
metadata:
  name: standard-forgerock-example
spec:
  appConfig:
    createKubernetesObjects: true
    secretsManager: GCP
    gcpProjectID: example-project-id
```

### Importing your own secrets

In addition to generating secrets, the `secret-agent` allow users to import their own secrets. This is especially useful for things like certificates and certificate authorities that can be referenced by other secrets in the SAC. For example, a user can import their organization's CA and use it to sign certificates generated by the `secret-agent`.

All that is required is to provide a Kubernetes secret with the same name and same key names as described in the SAC. It is important to note that if the [cloud backup](#enabling-cloud-backup) feature is enabled, the secret to be imported must be provided using the cloud manager's secret manager. The `secret-agent` will ignore local secrets if [cloud backup](#enabling-cloud-backup) is enabled.

### Naming Convention For Cloud Backups

There is a naming convention used by `secret-agent` to store and read secrets from the cloud secret managers. In general, the names follow the format:

```bash
$prefix-$namespace-$secretName-$keyName [If secretsManagerPrefix is provided]
$namespace-$secretName-$keyName [If no prefix is provided]
```

Due to cloud provider limitations, all `/`, `.` and `_` characters in secret names are replaced by `-` when accessing the cloud secret managers.

For example, consider the following secret agent configuration:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secret-agent.secrets.forgerock.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretAgentConfiguration
metadata:
  name: forgerock-sac
  namespace: dev
spec:
  appConfig:
    secretsManagerPrefix: "devCluster"
    awsRegion: us-east-1
    secretsManager: AWS
  secrets:
  - name: ds-passwords
    keys:
      - name: dirmanager.pw
        type: password
```

The secret generated by the this SAC would be stored as `devCluster-dev-ds-passwords-dirmanager-pw` in the AWS Secret Manager. The same name would apply to other cloud providers.

Some key types require more than one secret to be backed up. Such key types require a public and private components stored separately. This is the case for key types: `ca`, `keypair`, `ssh` and `keytool`. These secrets use the same naming convention described above and append a suffix to the main name as constructed previously.

Key Type | Name
--- | ---
`ca`      | $NAME-pem<br>$NAME-private-pem
`keypair` | $NAME-pem<br>$NAME-private-pem
`ssh`     | $NAME<br>$NAME-pub
`keytool` | $NAME<br>$NAME-storepass<br>$NAME-keypass

In the preceding table, `$NAME` follows the convention at the top of this section.

## Examples

We provide a sample SAC that exercises all features of the `secret-agent`. See the [samples folder](config/samples).

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using `make tests`. Some of the tests exercise parts of the code that uses `keytool`, and `kubebuilder`tools. Those must be installed locally in order to run the tests. Another option is to use docker:

* Ensure you're Kubernetes context is pointing to a test cluster, such as `minikube`, then
  * `docker build -t gcr.io/forgerock-io/secret-agent-testing:latest -f --target=tester .`
  * `docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/root/go/src/github.com/ForgeRock/secret-agent gcr.io/forgerock-io/secret-agent-testing:latest`
  * `go test ./...`
